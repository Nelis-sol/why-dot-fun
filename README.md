# Gamecall (otherwise known as why.fun)

With gamecall, users can call with an AI agent and complete a challenge. The AI agent has access to a **phonenumber** (through Twilio), a **crypto-wallet** (on Solana), a **social media account** (on Twitter/X). 
Additionally, the AI agent has capabailities to **generate video content** based on the conversation it has with the caller. Anyone can submit a new challenge through the API (a 1 SOL fee + prizepool for winning callers). This includes prompting the AI agent and instructing it on how to judge winning and losing attempts. Gamecall also allows calls through the browser.

**The AI agent works fully autonomously**: interacting and having conversations with the caller, judging the attempt, paying out the prize, texting the result to the caller, generating video content, and write the tweet and post it on X witht the generated video of the call interaction.
