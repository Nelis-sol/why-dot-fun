# Gamecall (otherwise known as why.fun)

With gamecall, users can call with an AI agent and complete a challenge. The AI agent has access to a **phonenumber** (through Twilio), a **crypto-wallet** (on Solana), a **social media account** (on Twitter/X). 
Additionally, the AI agent has capabailities to **generate video content** based on the conversation it has with the caller. Anyone can submit a new challenge through the API (a 1 SOL fee + prizepool for winning callers). This includes prompting the AI agent and instructing it on how to judge winning and losing attempts. Gamecall also allows calls through the browser.

**The AI agent works fully autonomously**: 
⋅⋅***(1) interacting and having conversations with the caller**, 
(2) judging the attempt, (3) paying out the prize, (4) texting the result to the caller, (5) generating video content, (6) moderate/decide if content is suitable for posting on socials, and (7) write the tweet and post it on X witht the generated video of the call interaction.**
